In order to build Wrapl/Riva, you will need the following programs/libraries:
1. Gcc:
	http://gcc.gnu.org
2. Omake:
	http://omake.metaprl.org
3: libConfuse:
	http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/
4: Lua:
	http://www.lua.org/

For installation under Windows, you will also need:
5. Mingw:
	http://www.mingw.org/

In addition, several other libraries are required, but are automatically downloaded, extracted and built (for use within Wrapl only, no changes to any other installed version are made).
6: Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector:
	http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/
7: GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP):
	http://gmplib.org/


After building/installing the above libraries, change into the dev directory
(where this file is) and run omake.
After building, you will have to create bin/riva.conf by copying and modifying
bin/riva.conf.<platform> where <platform> is either linux or windows.
You will also need to edit bin/wrapl (under linux) or bin/wrapl.bat (under
Windows) and change the first line to point to the riva binary.

Run wrapl without arguments and you should get an interactive Wrapl console:

Interactive Wrapl Version: [Version details]
--> 

which you can exit by pressing Ctrl+C.

To run a single Wrapl module, run riva <modulename>.
